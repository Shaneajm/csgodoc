## Getting Started

This website contains solutions to the book [**Introduction to Algorithms** _Third Edition_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)
by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson),
[Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest) and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein).
The website is inspired by the already existing **[solution website](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/)** organized by [Jay Chen](https://github.com/walkccc).

The primary goal of this page is to aid students at AAU attending the AD1 course by assuring they have solved the problem exercises correctly.
If this is not the case, one can study the problem solutions to aquire knowledge regarding their mistakes.
